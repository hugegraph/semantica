# HugeGraph graph-store backend

`HugeGraphStore` adapts Apache HugeGraph to Semantica's property-graph store
contract without translating Cypher. It uses `pyhugegraph` for schema and graph
CRUD, the native Gremlin REST endpoint for parameterized queries, and HugeGraph
traverser APIs for supported algorithms.

## Install

```bash
pip install "hugegraph-python>=1.7.1"
```

The dependency is optional. Importing Semantica without `hugegraph-python`
continues to work; constructing or connecting a HugeGraph backend requires it.

## Read an existing graph

Use `read_only=True` for retrieval and GraphRAG experiments over an existing
business graph:

```python
from semantica.graph_store.hugegraph_store import HugeGraphStore

store = HugeGraphStore(
    uri="http://localhost:8080",
    graph="hugegraph",
    graphspace="DEFAULT",  # omit when graphspaces are disabled
    user="admin",
    password="hugegraph",
    read_only=True,
)
store.connect()

actors = store.get_nodes(labels=["Actor"], properties={"name": "Alice"})
local_context = store.get_neighbors(actors[0]["id"], depth=2)
```

`read_only` rejects schema, index, node, and edge mutations. It does not rely on
server-side permissions, so production deployments should still use a
least-privilege HugeGraph account.

## Strong schema and writes

HugeGraph has a strong schema and one physical label per vertex. Write-enabled
code must apply an explicit schema and map any semantic multi-label model to one
physical HugeGraph vertex label:

```python
store = HugeGraphStore(
    uri="http://localhost:8080",
    graph="semantica_test",
    user="admin",
    password="hugegraph",
)
store.connect()
store.apply_schema(
    {
        "propertykeys": [
            {"name": "name", "data_type": "TEXT", "cardinality": "SINGLE"},
        ],
        "vertexlabels": [
            {
                "name": "Actor",
                "id_strategy": "CUSTOMIZE_STRING",
                "properties": ["name"],
                "nullable_keys": ["name"],
            }
        ],
        "edgelabels": [
            {
                "name": "KNOWS",
                "source_label": "Actor",
                "target_label": "Actor",
                "frequency": "MULTIPLE",
            }
        ],
        "indexlabels": [
            {
                "name": "idx_actor_name",
                "base_type": "VERTEX_LABEL",
                "base_value": "Actor",
                "index_type": "SEARCH",
                "fields": ["name"],
            }
        ],
    }
)
```

Before creating missing definitions, `apply_schema()` compares any same-named
existing definitions and rejects incompatible data types, ID strategies, label
links, multiplicity, or index fields. This prevents `ifNotExist()` from silently
accepting a different physical schema.

Batch vertex creation uses HugeGraph's native batch endpoint when all IDs are
automatic. If any vertex has an explicit `id`, the adapter preserves it by using
the single-vertex endpoint. Batch edges resolve or accept endpoint labels because
HugeGraph's batch edge API requires `outVLabel` and `inVLabel`.

## Query and traversal semantics

- `execute_query(query, parameters)` executes Gremlin-Groovy with bindings and
  returns Semantica's common `{success, records, keys, metadata}` envelope.
- `get_neighbors()` performs bounded 1-N hop expansion and returns each node with
  `distance`, `path`, and `path_relationships`; it never loads the full graph.
- `shortest_path()` prefers HugeGraph's native traverser, then falls back to a
  bounded direction/edge-label-aware BFS when filtering is required.
- `execute_native_algorithm()` exposes a small allowlist of HugeGraph traversers,
  including K-out, K-neighbor, shortest paths, and PersonalRank. It is an
  extension point, not a second algorithm framework.
- `search_nodes()` is deterministic bounded lexical entry-node retrieval for the
  ContextRetriever adapter. It is deliberately separate from raw Gremlin.

Nodes are normalized as `{id, labels, properties}` and relationships as
`{id, type, start_node_id, end_node_id, properties}`. HugeGraph edge IDs are kept
opaque, so multiple edges and sort-key-generated IDs are not rewritten.

## Test scope

The unit suite uses a behaviorally accurate fake `pyhugegraph` client and covers
strong-schema conflicts, custom IDs, node and relationship CRUD, native batches,
multiple directed edges, bounded multi-hop traversal, shortest paths,
parameterized Gremlin envelopes, native algorithm dispatch, read-only mode, and
Chinese lexical entry-node matching. A live HugeGraph container remains the
required integration gate for release certification.


## Unified GraphStore factory

Applications that only need Semantica's common graph-store API can construct the
backend through the public factory:

```python
from semantica.graph_store import GraphStore

store = GraphStore(
    backend="hugegraph",
    uri="https://hugegraph.example.com",
    graph="hugegraph",
    user="reader",
    password="secret",
    read_only=True,
)
```

Install the optional backend with `pip install "semantica[graph-hugegraph]"`.
Backend-specific entry-node search and native traverser extensions remain on
`HugeGraphStore`. Credentialed requests require HTTPS unless the target is a
loopback endpoint.
